# Jeopardy
## Question game with a right or wrong answer, with three levels of difficulty and a points system.
Followed along with a video on youtube to use as a reinforcement with what i am currently learning.
### What i leanred from the video:
+ How to do Objects and Arrays in Javascript better.
+ How to target a specific element from HTML in Javascript.
+ How to CREATE elements in javascript.

#### TO NOTE: THIS IS NOT MY WORK THAT I CREATED
It was a follow along project that i did to help on some areas i am learning, which aided me successfully,
although i know there are still areas i need to work on.
